# The Questions
Here are the questions I aim to answer:

1. Which job role had the highest percentage of job postings?
2. Which country recorded the highest number of job openings?
3. Which companies were the top recruiters based on job postings?
4. Which job posting platform is used the most by employers?
5. What percentage of job postings offer work-from-home options, require a degree, or provide health insurance?

# Data Preparation and Cleanup
I began by importing the necessary libraries and loading the dataset, then performed initial data cleaning tasks to ensure data quality.

```python
# Importing libraries
import ast
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Loading data 
df = pd.read_csv(r"...\data_jobs.csv")

# Data Cleaning
df = df.drop(columns=['salary_rate', 'salary_year_avg', 'salary_hour_avg'])  # Drop columns with more than 60% null values
df = df.dropna()  # Drop rows containing null values
df = df.drop_duplicates()  # Remove duplicate rows
df['job_via'] = df['job_via'].str.replace(r'\s*via\s*', '', regex=True)  # Remove 'via' from values in the column
df['job_skills'] = df['job_skills'].apply(lambda x: ast.literal_eval(x))  # Convert string representations of lists to actual Python lists
df['job_posted_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['job_posted_date'])  # Convert to datetime format

```
